# PowerBall

2. Use `python main.py` to run the code
## How the simulator works
First the simulator asks you what game mode would you prefer to play on. It will ask if you want to play on `real mode` or `Fixed win`. When fixed win is chosen then the simulator will show you the answer along with the instruction to play right away guarantying you a win. Though if you choose the real mode then it will be the normal power ball. When the game starts it will ask you for 5 numbers from 1 to 69. Then the program checks that the received data is acceptable if not then the user is required to type again. Next the simulator will ask for the power ball number. The same thing applies. Lastly it will also ask for the amount of time you will play and tell you how much it is going to cost. Then the program randoms numbers for the number and the power ball. Next it checks if your number matches the randomized number and if yes you win but if no you lose.
